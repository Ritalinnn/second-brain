#Directions
1. Blend the cashews and water in a high powered blender until liquified (soak the cashews overnight if you don't have a high powered blender). Set aside the cashew cream 
2. Bring a pot of water to boil for the pasta 
3. Slice the cremini mushrooms and dice the red onion. Finely chop the garlic 
4. Heat up a sauté pan to medium heat. Add in the mushrooms and cook for a few minutes. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper to taste. Add 1 tsp chili oil and sauté for another couple of minutes. Set the mushrooms aside 
5. Boil the fusilli (or pasta of choice) for 1min less to package instructions 
6. Place the sauté pan back on medium heat. Add 2 tbsp chili oil followed by the red onions. Sauté for 3-4min. Add the garlic and sauté for another minute. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper to taste 
7. Add the tomato paste and sauté for a couple of minutes. Add in the white wine. Stir and cook for a few minutes 
8. When the pasta is done, save about 1/4 cup of pasta water. Strain out the pasta. Add the pasta water to the sauté pan along with half of the cashew cream 
9. Give the pan a good stir. Add in the pasta and mushrooms. Stir and cook for another minute (beware not to overcook as the cream can thicken quite quickly) 
10. Turn the heat off and add the plantbased cheese. Give the pan a stir 
11. Plate the pasta and garnish with freshly chopped parsley
